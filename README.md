# Introduction
This application was built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app is a markdown editor.

# Motivation
Some key factors that drove me to develop this app include:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Electron allows for seamless deployment on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Modern Technologies**: Using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for building a desktop application.
- **Personal Learning**: Gaining experience with Electron and enhancing my skills in desktop application development.

# Why Electron Forge
I chose to use Electron Forge for this project because it simplifies the process of developing and packaging Electron applications. Electron Forge provides a comprehensive toolset that integrates seamlessly with the Electron ecosystem, offering several benefits:

- **Streamlined Setup**: Electron Forge sets up everything you need to start building your app, including configuration files, dependencies, and project structure.
- **Built-In Build Tools**: It comes with built-in support for packaging and distributing your app, making it easy to create installers for all major operating systems.
- **Easy Configuration**: Managing settings and configurations is straightforward with Electron Forge, reducing the complexity involved in customizing your build process.
- **Plugin Support**: Electron Forge supports a variety of plugins that extend its functionality, such as auto-updating, linting, and more.
- **Active Community and Documentation**: The tool is well-documented and maintained by an active community, ensuring you have access to the latest features and support.

By using Electron Forge, I was able to focus more on developing the core features of the app rather than worrying about the setup and build processes.
